Setup a google cloud api key and use that and input that into the code.
(To set up the Google Cloud Location API, you can follow these steps:

Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project: If you don't already have a GCP project, create one by logging into the GCP console (console.cloud.google.com) and clicking on "Create Project" in the top navigation bar.

Enable the Cloud Location API: Once you have a project, you need to enable the Cloud Location API. Go to the APIs & Services page in the console, search for "Cloud Location API," and click on it. Then click the "Enable" button.

Create an API key: After enabling the Cloud Location API, you need to create an API key to authenticate your application. Go to the Credentials page in the console, select "Create Credentials," and choose "API Key." You can then copy the API key for use in your application.

Set up billing: To use the Cloud Location API, you need to enable billing for your project. Go to the Billing page in the console, select your project, and set up a billing account if you haven't already.

Use the API: With the Cloud Location API enabled and an API key created, you can start using the API in your application. The API documentation provides instructions and examples for using the API with various programming languages and platforms.)

Setup a ipstack api key and use that and input that into the code.
(Creating an API key for an IP stack service typically involves the following steps:

Sign up for an IP stack service: You need to register for an IP stack service that provides an API and obtain your API credentials. Examples of such services include ipstack, GeoIP, and ipdata.

Log in to the IP stack service dashboard: Once you have signed up, log in to the dashboard of the IP stack service you have chosen.

Navigate to the API key section: Look for the API key section in the dashboard. It may be under the "Account" or "API" menu.

Generate a new API key: Click on the "Generate new API key" button or similar option. You may be prompted to provide a name for the API key or select from some predefined options.

Obtain your API key: Once you have generated the API key, copy it and keep it somewhere safe. Some services may also allow you to download the key as a file or send it to your email.

Integrate the API key into your application: Finally, you need to integrate the API key into your application by passing it as a parameter with each API request. The exact way to do this depends on the programming language and framework you are using.)
